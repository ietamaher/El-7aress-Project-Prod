## ⚠️ WARNINGS AND CAUTIONS

### **WARNING**
**LETHAL WEAPON SYSTEM**: This system controls a live weapon platform. Failure to follow safety procedures can result in death or serious injury. Always treat the weapon as if it is loaded and armed.

### **WARNING**
**NO-FIRE ZONES**: Always verify reticle position is NOT in a no-fire zone before engaging. Violating no-fire zones may result in friendly casualties or civilian harm.

### **WARNING**
**EMERGENCY STOP**: The emergency stop button must be accessible at all times. Know its location and be prepared to activate immediately if unsafe conditions develop.

### **CAUTION**
**ELECTRICAL HAZARDS**: The RCWS operates on high-voltage power systems. Only qualified personnel shall perform maintenance. Disconnect power before servicing.

### **WARNING**
**MOVING PARTS**: The gimbal system contains high-speed rotating components. Keep clear of moving parts during operation. Do not place hands or objects near turret during movement.

### **CAUTION**
**CAMERA DAMAGE**: Do not point cameras directly at the sun or intense light sources. Permanent sensor damage may occur.

### **WARNING**
**DEAD MAN SWITCH**: The Dead Man Switch must be held during all weapon operations. Release immediately in emergency situations to safe the weapon.
