**Key Points:**
- Operator sees video on DCU and controls gimbal with joystick
- Control computer processes all inputs and manages subsystems
- Cameras provide real-time video feedback
- System is a closed-loop: operator adjusts based on what they see

**You don't need to understand the electronics, just the concept:**
- **INPUT**: Your joystick commands
- **PROCESSING**: Computer calculates aim point with ballistics
- **OUTPUT**: Gimbal moves, weapon fires
- **FEEDBACK**: You see results on screen and adjust

## 1.5 SAFETY ZONE CONCEPTS

### NO-FIRE ZONES

**Definition**: Geographic areas where weapon discharge is absolutely prohibited.

**Purpose**:
- Protect friendly forces
- Protect civilians and infrastructure
- Prevent fratricide
- Comply with rules of engagement (ROE)

**How It Works**:
- Zones are pre-programmed by command
- System monitors gimbal position continuously
- **OSD displays "NO-FIRE ZONE" warning** when reticle enters zone
- Trigger is **software locked** when in no-fire zone
- Override requires commander authorization code

**Example No-Fire Zones**:
- Friendly vehicle positions
- Civilian buildings (schools, hospitals, mosques)
- Infrastructure (power plants, water treatment)
- Friendly patrol routes

**Operator Responsibility**:
- **Always check OSD for no-fire zone warning before engaging**
- Do not attempt to fire if warning is displayed
- Report zone boundary errors to command
- Never share override codes

---

### NO-TRAVERSE ZONES

**Definition**: Geographic areas where gimbal movement is restricted or prohibited.

**Purpose**:
- Prevent gimbal from hitting vehicle structure
- Protect antennas, equipment, or personnel on vehicle
- Prevent pointing weapon at vehicle crew positions
- Avoid damaging cables or sensors

**How It Works**:
- Zones are defined during system installation
- Gimbal slew is **automatically stopped** at zone boundary
- You will feel joystick resistance near boundary
- **OSD displays "NO-TRAVERSE" warning** when approaching zone
- System prevents entry even if you force joystick

**Example No-Traverse Zones**:
- Rear 90° arc (to avoid vehicle cabin)
- Areas with antennas or equipment
- Personnel access hatches
- Cable routing areas

**Operator Responsibility**:
- Learn your vehicle's no-traverse zones
- Do not fight the system if gimbal stops
- Report if zones are too restrictive for mission
- Never disable no-traverse zones without authorization

---

### ZONE VIOLATION PROCEDURES

**If you accidentally enter a zone:**

1. **Release Trigger Immediately** (if weapon armed)
2. **Slew gimbal out of zone** using joystick
3. **Verify OSD warning clears**
4. **Report incident** to supervisor
5. **Do not re-enter zone** unless mission requires and authorized

**If system prevents zone entry but mission requires it:**

1. **Do NOT force the system**
2. **Report to commander** immediately
3. **Request zone boundary adjustment** if appropriate
4. **Obtain override authorization** if permitted by ROE
5. **Document all overrides** in mission log

**REMEMBER**: Zones exist for safety. Violating zones can kill friendlies.

---

#### **WEAPON TRIGGER**

**Location**: Front of joystick grip, inside trigger guard

**Function**: Fires weapon (when all safety interlocks satisfied)

**Trigger Pull Technique**:
1. Place index finger on trigger
2. Take up slack (first stage - no resistance)
3. Breathe out slowly
4. Squeeze smoothly (second stage - resistance increases)
5. **BANG** - weapon fires
6. Hold trigger for burst mode, release for single shot

**Safety Interlocks** (all must be met):
- ✅ Gun Armed switch in ARM position
- ✅ Dead Man Switch held
- ✅ Authorized (if required)
- ✅ Not in no-fire zone
- ✅ Ammo loaded

**If Trigger Pulls But No Fire**:
- Check Gun Armed light (RED = armed)
- Check Dead Man Switch is engaged
- Check Authorized light (if applicable)
- Check OSD for "NO-FIRE ZONE" warning
- Check weapon is loaded
- If all OK, possible weapon malfunction (report to maintenance)

---

#### **DEAD MAN SWITCH**

**Location**: Rear of joystick grip (squeeze with palm/fingers)

**Function**: Safety device - must be held for weapon operation

**Operation**:
- **Squeezed** → Dead Man Switch engaged (weapon can fire if other conditions met)
- **Released** → Dead Man Switch disengaged (weapon safed immediately)

**Purpose**:
- Prevents accidental discharge if operator is incapacitated
- Automatic safety if operator loses grip
- Required safety interlock for firing

**Proper Technique**:
- Hold naturally as part of grip
- Don't squeeze too hard (causes fatigue)
- Practice rapid release (for emergencies)

**⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY RULE**: Release Dead Man Switch immediately when not actively engaging a target.

**Failure Mode**:
- If Dead Man Switch fails to spring back → **NO-GO** condition
- Report to maintenance immediately
- Do not operate system
