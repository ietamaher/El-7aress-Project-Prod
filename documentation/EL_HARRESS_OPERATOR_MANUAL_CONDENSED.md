**Key Points:**
- Operator sees video on DCU and controls gimbal with joystick
- Control computer processes all inputs and manages subsystems
- Cameras provide real-time video feedback
- System is a closed-loop: operator adjusts based on what they see

**You don't need to understand the electronics, just the concept:**
- **INPUT**: Your joystick commands
- **PROCESSING**: Computer calculates aim point with ballistics
- **OUTPUT**: Gimbal moves, weapon fires
- **FEEDBACK**: You see results on screen and adjust

## 1.5 SAFETY ZONE CONCEPTS

### NO-FIRE ZONES

**Definition**: Geographic areas where weapon discharge is absolutely prohibited.

**Purpose**:
- Protect friendly forces
- Protect civilians and infrastructure
- Prevent fratricide
- Comply with rules of engagement (ROE)

**How It Works**:
- Zones are pre-programmed by command
- System monitors gimbal position continuously
- **OSD displays "NO-FIRE ZONE" warning** when reticle enters zone
- Trigger is **software locked** when in no-fire zone
- Override requires commander authorization code

**Example No-Fire Zones**:
- Friendly vehicle positions
- Civilian buildings (schools, hospitals, mosques)
- Infrastructure (power plants, water treatment)
- Friendly patrol routes

**Operator Responsibility**:
- **Always check OSD for no-fire zone warning before engaging**
- Do not attempt to fire if warning is displayed
- Report zone boundary errors to command
- Never share override codes

---

### NO-TRAVERSE ZONES

**Definition**: Geographic areas where gimbal movement is restricted or prohibited.

**Purpose**:
- Prevent gimbal from hitting vehicle structure
- Protect antennas, equipment, or personnel on vehicle
- Prevent pointing weapon at vehicle crew positions
- Avoid damaging cables or sensors

**How It Works**:
- Zones are defined during system installation
- Gimbal slew is **automatically stopped** at zone boundary
- You will feel joystick resistance near boundary
- **OSD displays "NO-TRAVERSE" warning** when approaching zone
- System prevents entry even if you force joystick

**Example No-Traverse Zones**:
- Rear 90° arc (to avoid vehicle cabin)
- Areas with antennas or equipment
- Personnel access hatches
- Cable routing areas

**Operator Responsibility**:
- Learn your vehicle's no-traverse zones
- Do not fight the system if gimbal stops
- Report if zones are too restrictive for mission
- Never disable no-traverse zones without authorization

---

### ZONE VIOLATION PROCEDURES

**If you accidentally enter a zone:**

1. **Release Trigger Immediately** (if weapon armed)
2. **Slew gimbal out of zone** using joystick
3. **Verify OSD warning clears**
4. **Report incident** to supervisor
5. **Do not re-enter zone** unless mission requires and authorized

**If system prevents zone entry but mission requires it:**

1. **Do NOT force the system**
2. **Report to commander** immediately
3. **Request zone boundary adjustment** if appropriate
4. **Obtain override authorization** if permitted by ROE
5. **Document all overrides** in mission log

**REMEMBER**: Zones exist for safety. Violating zones can kill friendlies.

---

#### **WEAPON TRIGGER**

**Location**: Front of joystick grip, inside trigger guard

**Function**: Fires weapon (when all safety interlocks satisfied)

**Trigger Pull Technique**:
1. Place index finger on trigger
2. Take up slack (first stage - no resistance)
3. Breathe out slowly
4. Squeeze smoothly (second stage - resistance increases)
5. **BANG** - weapon fires
6. Hold trigger for burst mode, release for single shot

**Safety Interlocks** (all must be met):
- ✅ Gun Armed switch in ARM position
- ✅ Dead Man Switch held
- ✅ Authorized (if required)
- ✅ Not in no-fire zone
- ✅ Ammo loaded

**If Trigger Pulls But No Fire**:
- Check Gun Armed light (RED = armed)
- Check Dead Man Switch is engaged
- Check Authorized light (if applicable)
- Check OSD for "NO-FIRE ZONE" warning
- Check weapon is loaded
- If all OK, possible weapon malfunction (report to maintenance)

---

#### **DEAD MAN SWITCH**

**Location**: Rear of joystick grip (squeeze with palm/fingers)

**Function**: Safety device - must be held for weapon operation

**Operation**:
- **Squeezed** → Dead Man Switch engaged (weapon can fire if other conditions met)
- **Released** → Dead Man Switch disengaged (weapon safed immediately)

**Purpose**:
- Prevents accidental discharge if operator is incapacitated
- Automatic safety if operator loses grip
- Required safety interlock for firing

**Proper Technique**:
- Hold naturally as part of grip
- Don't squeeze too hard (causes fatigue)
- Practice rapid release (for emergencies)

**⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY RULE**: Release Dead Man Switch immediately when not actively engaging a target.

**Failure Mode**:
- If Dead Man Switch fails to spring back → **NO-GO** condition
- Report to maintenance immediately
- Do not operate system

# LESSON 4: MOTION MODES & SURVEILLANCE

**Lesson Duration:** 3 hours (Classroom + Practical)

**Learning Objectives:**
- Explain the purpose of each motion mode
- Switch between motion modes safely
- Operate automatic sector scan mode
- Utilize Target Reference Point (TRP) scan mode
- Define and manage no-fire zones
- Define and manage no-traverse zones
- Save and load zone configurations

---

## 4.1 MOTION MODES OVERVIEW

### **WHAT ARE MOTION MODES?**

Motion modes control **how the gimbal moves** during operations:

- **Manual Mode**: You control gimbal directly with joystick
- **Auto Sector Scan**: System automatically scans between two points
- **TRP Scan**: System sequentially visits pre-defined Target Reference Points
- **Radar Slew** (if equipped): Gimbal follows radar detections

**Purpose**: Different missions require different surveillance patterns. Motion modes let you switch between direct control and automated surveillance.

---

### **MODE SELECTION**

**How to Change Modes**:
- Press joystick **Button 11** or **Button 13** (either button cycles modes)
- Modes cycle in sequence:
  ```
  Manual → AutoSectorScan → TRP Scan → Radar Slew → Manual (loops)
  ```

**Current Mode Display**:
- OSD bottom center shows: **MODE: Manual**, **MODE: Sector Scan**, **MODE: TRP**, or **MODE: Radar**

**⚠️ RESTRICTION**: Cannot change modes during tracking acquisition. Must abort tracking first (press TRK button).

---

## 4.2 MANUAL MODE

**Description**: Direct operator control via joystick (default mode)

**When to Use**:
- Direct target engagement
- Precise aiming
- Immediate threat response
- Search operations requiring operator judgment

**Operation**:
- Joystick LEFT/RIGHT → Azimuth control
- Joystick UP/DOWN → Elevation control
- Stick deflection = gimbal speed
- Center stick = gimbal stops

**Already Covered**: See Lesson 2, Section 2.3 for detailed joystick control

**Transitioning Out of Manual**:
- Press Button 11 or 13
- Mode advances to next (AutoSectorScan)
- Gimbal behavior changes immediately

---

## 4.3 AUTO SECTOR SCAN MODE

### **WHAT IS SECTOR SCAN?**

**Definition**: Automated gimbal movement that continuously scans between two pre-defined points (left and right limits)

**Purpose**:
- Perimeter surveillance
- Monitoring a defined sector without operator input
- Frees operator to monitor other systems or threats

**Visual**:
```
    Left Limit              Right Limit
        ↓                       ↓
        ●←←←←←←←scan←←←←←←←●
        ●→→→→→→→scan→→→→→→→●
             (repeats)
```

Gimbal continuously scans left-to-right, then right-to-left, repeat.

---

### **ACTIVATING SECTOR SCAN**

**Prerequisites**:
1. Sector scan zone must be defined (see Section 4.7)
2. At least one sector scan zone exists
3. System is in AutoSectorScan mode

**Procedure**:

1. **Cycle to Sector Scan Mode**:
   - Press Button 11 or 13 until OSD shows: **MODE: Sector Scan**

2. **System Behavior**:
   - Gimbal automatically slews to **left limit** of active sector
   - Scans to **right limit** (slow, smooth movement)
   - Reverses, scans back to **left limit**
   - Repeats continuously

3. **Scan Speed**:
   - Default: ~5°/second (configurable in zone definition)
   - Allows visual inspection as sector scans

4. **Elevation**:
   - Scans at elevation defined in zone (usually 0° horizon)
   - Elevation can be fixed or variable (depending on zone setup)

---

### **WHILE SECTOR SCANNING**

**Operator Actions**:

**✅ CAN DO**:
- Monitor video feed as sector scans
- Switch cameras (CAM button)
- Zoom in/out (Zoom rocker)
- Fire LRF (LRF button) at targets of interest
- Initiate tracking (TRK button) - *aborts sector scan, switches to Manual*

**❌ CANNOT DO**:
- Joystick axes do NOT control gimbal (ignored)
- Cannot manually slew gimbal (must exit mode first)

**To Override**:
- Press Button 11/13 to return to Manual mode
- OR: Press TRK to start tracking (auto-switches to Manual)

---

### **PAUSING / RESUMING SCAN**

**Not Applicable**: Sector scan runs continuously. To stop:
- Cycle back to Manual mode (Button 11/13)

**Tip**: If you need to temporarily examine something in the sector, use **Manual** mode to stop, then return to **AutoSectorScan** when ready.

---

### **MULTIPLE SECTOR ZONES**

**If Multiple Sectors Defined**:
- System scans **active sector** (last selected via menu)
- To change active sector:
  1. Cycle to Manual mode
  2. Access menu: Zone Definitions → Sector Scans
  3. Select desired sector
  4. Return to AutoSectorScan mode

---

## 4.4 TRP SCAN MODE

### **WHAT IS TRP SCAN?**

**TRP** = **Target Reference Point** (pre-defined location of interest)

**Definition**: System sequentially slews to each TRP, dwells (pauses) for observation, then moves to next TRP in list.

**Purpose**:
- Checkpoint verification (e.g., gate 1, gate 2, gate 3)
- Known threat areas (e.g., sniper hide sites)
- Periodic scans of fixed locations
- More efficient than manual searching

**Visual**:
```
TRP 1 (30s dwell) → TRP 2 (30s dwell) → TRP 3 (30s dwell) → TRP 1 (repeat)
```

---

### **ACTIVATING TRP SCAN**

**Prerequisites**:
1. At least one TRP must be defined (see Section 4.8)
2. System is in TRP Scan mode

**Procedure**:

1. **Cycle to TRP Scan Mode**:
   - Press Button 11 or 13 until OSD shows: **MODE: TRP**

2. **System Behavior**:
   - Gimbal slews to **first TRP** in list
   - **Dwells** for configured time (default: 30 seconds)
   - Slews to **next TRP**
   - Dwells again
   - Repeats through entire TRP list, then loops back to first TRP

3. **Dwell Time**:
   - Configurable per TRP (5-120 seconds)
   - Allows operator to observe location before moving on

---

### **WHILE TRP SCANNING**

**Operator Actions**:

**During Dwell** (gimbal stationary at TRP):
- ✅ Observe video
- ✅ Switch cameras
- ✅ Zoom
- ✅ Fire LRF
- ✅ Initiate tracking (if threat detected)

**During Slew** (gimbal moving between TRPs):
- Gimbal is in motion
- Video may be blurred (fast slew)
- Wait for next dwell to observe

**To Skip to Next TRP**:
- **Not directly available** - must wait for dwell to complete, OR
- Cycle to Manual, reposition, cycle back to TRP mode (restarts from TRP 1)

---

### **TRP SCAN BEST PRACTICES**

1. **Define TRPs During Planning**:
   - Pre-mission: Identify key locations
   - Enter TRP coordinates via menu (Section 4.8)
   - Test TRP scan before mission start

2. **Prioritize TRPs**:
   - Place highest-threat areas first in list
   - System visits TRPs in order defined

3. **Appropriate Dwell Times**:
   - Short dwell (10-15s) for quick checks
   - Long dwell (60s+) for detailed observation or known threat areas

4. **Combine with Manual**:
   - Use TRP scan for routine surveillance
   - Switch to Manual when threat detected

---

## 4.5 RADAR SLEW MODE (OPTIONAL)

**Availability**: Only if radar system is integrated

**Description**: Gimbal automatically slews to radar-detected targets

**Purpose**:
- Rapid threat response
- Automated cueing from radar
- Reduces operator workload

**Operation**:

1. **Cycle to Radar Slew Mode**:
   - Press Button 11/13 until OSD shows: **MODE: Radar**

2. **System Behavior**:
   - Waits for radar detection
   - When radar detects target → Gimbal slews to radar coordinates
   - OSD displays: **RADAR CUE** or **SLEWING TO RADAR**
   - Operator confirms threat visually on video

3. **Operator Decision**:
   - If threat confirmed → Initiate tracking (TRK button) or engage
   - If false alarm → Wait for next radar cue, OR cycle to Manual

**⚠️ NOTE**: Most El 7arress RCWS systems do NOT have radar. This mode will show "RADAR NOT AVAILABLE" if no radar connected.

---

## 4.11 SURVEILLANCE BEST PRACTICES

### **CHOOSING THE RIGHT MODE**

| Situation | Recommended Mode | Rationale |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Direct threat engagement | Manual | Full operator control, immediate response |
| Perimeter watch (quiet) | AutoSectorScan | Automated, frees attention, consistent coverage |
| Checkpoint routine | TRP Scan | Efficient for fixed locations, repeatable |
| High-threat area scan | Manual | Requires operator judgment, unpredictable threats |
| Radar-integrated ops | Radar Slew (if available) | Rapid response to radar cues |

---

### **COMBINING MODES WITH TRACKING**

**Workflow Example**:

1. **Start in AutoSectorScan** (perimeter surveillance)
2. **Threat detected** during scan
3. **Press TRK** → System switches to Manual, starts tracking acquisition
4. **Lock onto threat** (second TRK press)

# LESSON 5: TARGET ENGAGEMENT PROCESS

**Lesson Duration:** 4 hours (Classroom 1h + Simulator 3h)

**Learning Objectives:**
- Execute complete target engagement sequence
- Operate tracking system through all phases
- Adjust acquisition gate for target selection
- Perform emergency tracking abort
- Execute simulated weapons engagement

---

## 5.1 TARGET ENGAGEMENT SEQUENCE

### **THE SIX-PHASE ENGAGEMENT CYCLE**

```
1. DETECT    → 2. IDENTIFY → 3. ACQUIRE → 4. TRACK → 5. ENGAGE → 6. ASSESS
```

| Phase | Operator Actions | Expected Duration |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **1. DETECT** | Scan area (manual/auto modes), visual detection | Continuous |
| **2. IDENTIFY** | Slew to target, zoom in, PID (Positive ID), verify ROE | 5-15 seconds |
| **3. ACQUIRE** | Enter tracking acquisition, position gate, size gate | 5-10 seconds |
| **4. TRACK** | Lock-on, monitor track quality | Continuous until engagement |
| **5. ENGAGE** | Range, LAC (if moving), Master Arm, Fire, Observe | 2-30 seconds |
| **6. ASSESS** | BDA (Battle Damage Assessment), re-engage or cease | 5-10 seconds |

---

### **DETECT & IDENTIFY (PHASES 1-2)**

**Detection Methods**:
- Manual scan (joystick control)
- Auto Sector Scan (Lesson 4)
- TRP Scan (Lesson 4)
- Radar cues (if available)

**Identification Requirements**:
- **PID (Positive Identification)** mandatory before engagement
- Use zoom to magnify target (Button 6/8)
- Thermal camera may aid identification (night, obscurants)
- Verify target meets Rules of Engagement (ROE)
- Confirm NOT friendly forces

**⚠️ WARNING**: Failure to achieve PID before engagement violates ROE and may result in fratricide.

---

## 5.2 TRACKING SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### **TRACKING PHASE STATE MACHINE**

The tracking system operates through discrete phases:

```
    OFF
     ↓ [Button 4: Start Acquisition]
 ACQUISITION
     ↓ [Size gate with D-Pad]
     ↓ [Button 4: Request Lock-On]
LOCK PENDING
     ↓ [Tracker initializes]
ACTIVE LOCK ⟷ COAST
     ↓         [Target temporarily lost]
  FIRING
     ↓ [Cease fire or abort]
    OFF
```

### **TRACKING PHASE REFERENCE**

| Phase | OSD Status | Box Color | Box Style | Duration | Gimbal Control |
|-------|------------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Off** | MODE: Manual | None | N/A | Until acquisition | Operator (joystick) |
| **Acquisition** | ACQUISITION | Yellow | Solid | 5-10 sec | Operator (joystick) |
| **Lock Pending** | LOCK PENDING | Cyan | Solid/Flash | 0.5-2 sec | Operator (hold steady) |
| **Active Lock** | TRACKING | Green | Dashed | Continuous | Automatic (tracker) |
| **Coast** | TRACKING (COAST) | Yellow | Dashed | 1-5 sec | Automatic (predict) |
| **Firing** | TRACKING (FIRING) | Green | Solid | While firing | Automatic (hold) |

### **TRACKING CONTROLS**

| Control | Function | Active Phase(s) |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Button 4** (single press) | Start Acquisition / Request Lock-On | Off → Acquisition, Acquisition → Lock Pending |
| **Button 4** (double-click <500ms) | **EMERGENCY ABORT** | Any phase → Off |
| **D-Pad ▲** | Decrease gate height (-4 px) | Acquisition only |
| **D-Pad ▼** | Increase gate height (+4 px) | Acquisition only |
| **D-Pad ◄** | Decrease gate width (-4 px) | Acquisition only |
| **D-Pad ►** | Increase gate width (+4 px) | Acquisition only |

---

## 5.3 ACQUISITION PHASE

### **ENTERING ACQUISITION MODE**

**Prerequisites**:
- Motion mode: Manual
- Target on-screen and identified
- Target approximately centered in reticle

**Procedure**:

**1. Press Button 4 (Track Select)**

**Result**:
- System enters **ACQUISITION** phase
- Yellow acquisition gate appears (centered on reticle)
- OSD displays: **MODE: ACQUISITION**
- Joystick gimbal control remains active
- D-Pad now controls gate size

---

### **SIZING THE ACQUISITION GATE**

**Objective**: Frame target with 10-30% margin on all sides

**D-Pad Controls**:
- **UP ▲**: Decrease height
- **DOWN ▼**: Increase height
- **LEFT ◄**: Decrease width
- **RIGHT ►**: Increase width
- **Step size**: 4 pixels per press

**Gate Sizing Guidelines**:

| Target Framing | Effect on Tracking | Recommendation |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Too Tight (<10% margin) | Tracker may lose target if target rotates/expands | ❌ Avoid |
| Optimal (10-30% margin) | Best tracking performance | ✅ Ideal |
| Too Loose (>50% margin) | Background clutter may confuse tracker | ❌ Avoid |

**Best Practices**:
- **Vehicles**: Frame entire hull, exclude ground
- **Personnel**: Include torso/legs, minimize background
- **Moving targets**: Size slightly larger (anticipate motion)
- **Default size**: 100×100 pixels (adjust as needed)

---

### **REQUESTING LOCK-ON**

**When Ready**:
- Target fully visible and framed in gate
- Target has good contrast against background
- Target not moving erratically

**Action**: **Press Button 4** (second press)

**Result**:
- System → **LOCK PENDING** phase
- Gate color: Yellow → Cyan (or flashing)
- OSD: **MODE: LOCK PENDING**
- Tracker initialization begins (0.5-2 seconds)

**⚠️ CAUTION**: Do NOT make rapid gimbal movements during Lock Pending. Hold gimbal steady.

---

## 5.4 LOCK PENDING → ACTIVE LOCK

### **LOCK PENDING PHASE**

**Purpose**: Tracking system initializes on target

**Duration**: 0.5 to 2 seconds (typically ~1 second)

**Operator Action**: **WAIT** - maintain steady gimbal

**What Happens**:
1. System captures reference image of target
2. Initializes tracker algorithm
3. Calculates target features
4. Begins tracking target in video stream

**Transition Outcomes**:

**✅ SUCCESS**:
- System → **ACTIVE LOCK** phase
- Gate color: Green
- Gate style: Dashed outline
- OSD: **MODE: TRACKING** or **ACTIVE LOCK**
- Gimbal control switches to automatic

**❌ FAILURE** (rare):
- System → **ACQUISITION** phase (retry)
- Possible causes: Poor contrast, target too small, target motion
- Operator: Adjust gate size or abort and restart

---

### **ACTIVE LOCK PHASE**

**System Behavior**:
- Tracker follows target at 30 Hz (30 times/second)
- Gimbal automatically moves to keep target centered
- Reticle stays on target center
- **Joystick axis inputs IGNORED** (tracking in control)

**Visual Indicators**:
- **Tracking Gate**: Green dashed outline around target
- **OSD**: MODE: TRACKING or ACTIVE LOCK
- **Control Panel**: TRACKING light ON (green)
- **Track Confidence**: >70% (good), 50-70% (marginal), <50% (poor)

---

### **OPERATOR ROLE DURING ACTIVE LOCK**

**Primary Role**: **MONITOR** - system is tracking automatically

**Monitor For**:

1. **Track Quality**:
   - ✅ Green gate = Good track
   - ⚠️ Yellow gate = Marginal (may lose soon)
   - Track confidence >70% (good), <50% (prepare for coast)

2. **Target Status**:
   - Target correctly identified (didn't jump to wrong object)
   - Target still valid (meets engagement criteria)
   - Target not obscured or about to be obscured

3. **Gimbal Position**:
   - Staying within operational limits
   - Not approaching no-traverse zones
   - Elevation within -20° to +60°

**Controls Still Active**:
- ✅ Button 0 (Master Arm)
- ✅ Button 2 (LAC toggle)
- ✅ Button 3 (Dead Man Switch)
- ✅ Button 4 (double-click abort)
- ✅ Button 5 (Fire)
- ✅ Button 6/8 (Zoom) - use cautiously, may affect track
- ❌ Button 11/13 (Mode cycle) - BLOCKED during tracking
- ❌ Joystick axes (X/Y) - IGNORED during tracking

---

## 5.5 COAST MODE

### **WHEN COAST ACTIVATES**

**Triggers**:
- Target temporarily obscured (passes behind object)
- Target leaves field of view briefly
- Tracker loses visual lock
- Dust, smoke, or other obscurants

**System Behavior**:
- Tracker **predicts** target position based on last known velocity
- Gimbal continues to predicted position
- System attempts to re-acquire target
- Tracking gate: Green → Yellow (dashed)

**Display Changes**:
- **OSD**: MODE: COAST or TRACKING (COAST)
- **Gate**: Yellow/amber dashed outline
- **Warning**: "COASTING - TARGET LOST" may display

---

### **COAST OUTCOMES**

**Typical Duration**: 1-5 seconds

**Outcome 1: Target Re-Acquired** (✅ Success):
- Target reappears in field of view
- Tracker re-locks on target
- System → **ACTIVE LOCK** phase
- Gate: Yellow → Green
- Tracking continues normally

**Outcome 2: Coast Timeout** (❌ Failure):
- Target not re-acquired within timeout (~5 seconds)
- System gives up
- System → **OFF** phase
- Tracking stops
- Operator must restart tracking if desired

**Operator Action During Coast**:
- ✅ Wait patiently (system attempting re-acquisition)
- ✅ Be ready for track to resume
- ❌ Do NOT abort prematurely (give system time)
- ❌ Do NOT make manual gimbal movements (joystick ignored)

**Abort Coast If**:
- Target definitely not coming back (destroyed, permanently obscured)
- Tracker coasting in wrong direction (confused)
- Mission changed

---

## 5.6 TRACKING ABORT (EMERGENCY)

### **WHEN TO ABORT TRACKING**

Abort tracking **IMMEDIATELY** if:
- ❌ Tracking wrong target (friendly, civilian, incorrect target)
- ❌ Target no longer valid (fails ROE)
- ❌ Safety concern (entering no-fire zone, gimbal obstruction)
- ❌ Mission change (new priority, orders to cease)
- ❌ Tracking erratic (unexpected gimbal behavior)

---

### **ABORT PROCEDURE**

**Action**: **DOUBLE-CLICK BUTTON 4** (<500ms between presses)

**Effect** (IMMEDIATE):
1. Tracking **STOPS**
2. System → **OFF** phase
3. Gimbal holds current position
4. Tracking gate disappears
5. Weapon fire **INHIBITED** (even if Master Arm engaged)
6. OSD: MODE: MANUAL

**Timing**:
- Press 1 → Press 2 within **500 milliseconds** (half-second)
- **Too slow** (>500ms): System interprets as two single presses (may restart tracking)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Practice double-click timing during training until muscle memory established.

---

### **AFTER ABORT**

**System State**:
- Manual mode active
- Joystick gimbal control restored
- No tracking active

**Next Actions** (mission-dependent):
- Re-acquire correct target and restart tracking
- Return to surveillance mode
- Engage different target
- Follow commander's orders

---

## 5.7 WEAPONS ENGAGEMENT SEQUENCE

### **PRE-ENGAGEMENT CHECKLIST**

Before engaging, verify **ALL** items:

- ☐ Target positively identified (**PID**)
- ☐ Target valid (meets ROE)
- ☐ Fire authorization received (if required)
- ☐ NOT in no-fire zone (check OSD for zone warnings)
- ☐ Friendly forces clear
- ☐ Weapon loaded and ready
- ☐ Zeroing active (if applicable)
- ☐ Environmental parameters set (if applicable)
- ☐ Track established (if using tracking)

**⚠️ WARNING: IF ANY ITEM CANNOT BE CHECKED, DO NOT FIRE.**

---

### **ENGAGEMENT PROCEDURE (STEP-BY-STEP)**

#### **STEP 1: Acquire and Track Target**

1. Detect and identify target (PID mandatory)
2. **Button 4** → Enter acquisition mode
3. **D-Pad** → Size gate to frame target (10-30% margin)
4. **Button 4** → Request lock-on
5. Wait for **ACTIVE LOCK** (green gate, OSD: TRACKING)
6. Monitor track quality (confidence >70%, green gate)

---

#### **STEP 2: Range Target**

1. Fire Laser Range Finder (LRF trigger)
2. Wait for range reading (OSD: **RNG: xxxx m**)
3. Verify range reasonable
4. Range used for ballistic calculations (CCIP)

**Note**: LRF may fire automatically during tracking (configuration-dependent). Verify range displayed.

---

#### **STEP 3: Enable Lead Angle Compensation (If Moving Target)**

**If target is moving** (lateral motion, speed >5 m/s, range >100m):

1. Hold **Dead Man Switch** (Button 3)
2. Press **LAC Toggle** (Button 2)
3. Verify LAC status:
   - ✅ **"LEAD ANGLE ON"** (green) = Ready
   - ⚠️ **"LEAD ANGLE LAG"** (yellow) = Wait for tracking data
   - ❌ **"ZOOM OUT"** (red) = FOV too narrow, zoom out
4. Observe CCIP reticle offset ahead of target (lead point)

**If target stationary**: LAC not necessary (CCIP at target center)

**Detailed LAC procedures in Lesson 6.**

---

#### **STEP 4: Final Safety Checks**

1. Verify target still valid
2. Verify tracking active (green gate, good confidence)
3. Check OSD for warnings:
   - ❌ **"ZONE VIOLATION"** = DO NOT FIRE
   - ❌ **"NO-FIRE ZONE"** = DO NOT FIRE
   - ✅ No warnings = Clear to fire
4. Verify friendly forces clear
5. Verify backstop (if required)

---

#### **STEP 5: Engage Master Arm**

1. Pull trigger to **Stage 1** (half-pull) → **Master Arm** (Button 0)
   - OR toggle Master Arm switch on Control Panel
2. Verify **"ARMED"** indicator light ON (red)
3. OSD may display: **"WEAPON ARMED"**

**⚠️ WEAPON IS NOW HOT**

---

#### **STEP 6: Fire Weapon**

1. Final aim verification (CCIP on target or lead point)
2. Pull trigger to **Stage 2** (full-pull) → **Fire** (Button 5)
3. Weapon fires
4. Hold trigger for desired burst:
   - **Single Shot**: Quick press/release (1 round)
   - **Burst**: Hold 2-3 seconds (controlled burst)
   - **Sustained**: Hold longer (use cautiously)

**During Firing**:
- Tracking keeps reticle on target
- Gimbal compensates for recoil
- Observe rounds impacting
- Adjust fire as needed

**System State**:
- Tracking phase → **FIRING**
- OSD: MODE: TRACKING (FIRING)
- Gate: Green solid outline
- Enhanced stabilization active

---

#### **STEP 7: Cease Fire**

1. Release **Fire button** (Button 5 / trigger stage 2)
2. Weapon stops firing
3. Release **Master Arm** (Button 0 / trigger stage 1)
4. Verify **"ARMED"** indicator OFF
5. Tracking continues (unless aborted)

---

#### **STEP 8: Assess Target (BDA)**

**Battle Damage Assessment**:
- ✅ Target destroyed? → Stop tracking, report success
- ⚠️ Target damaged? → Re-engage (repeat Steps 5-7)
- ❌ Target missed? → Check zeroing/environmental/LAC, re-engage
- 🔄 Target suppressed? → Maintain track, ready to re-engage

---

#### **STEP 9: Post-Engagement Actions**

1. If target neutralized: **Stop tracking** (double-click Button 4)
2. Report engagement results to command
3. Update ammunition count
4. Scan for additional targets
5. Resume surveillance or follow orders

## 5.8 ENGAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES

### **TARGET SELECTION FOR TRACKING**

**Good Targets**:
- ✅ High contrast against background
- ✅ Clearly defined edges
- ✅ Sufficient size (>30 pixels)
- ✅ Relatively stable motion

**Difficult Targets**:
- ⚠️ Low contrast (camouflaged)
- ⚠️ Very small (distant)
- ⚠️ Erratic motion (evasive)
- ⚠️ Partially obscured

**If Tracking Fails**:
- Try manual engagement (no tracking)
- Improve contrast (switch camera or thermal LUT)
- Wait for better tracking opportunity

---

### **LEAD ANGLE COMPENSATION TIPS**

**When to Use LAC**:
- ✅ Target moving laterally (crossing FOV)
- ✅ Target speed >5 m/s (~10 mph)
- ✅ Range >100 meters

**When NOT Needed**:
- ❌ Stationary targets
- ❌ Targets moving radially (toward/away from you)
- ❌ Very close range (<50m)

**LAC Limitations**:
- Requires tracking active
- Requires sufficient FOV (may need to zoom out)
- Assumes constant target velocity (less accurate if maneuvering)

---

### **AMMUNITION CONSERVATION**

**Fire Discipline**:
- Use controlled bursts (2-5 rounds) vs. full-auto spray
- Assess after each burst before re-engaging
- Precision over volume

**Round Count**:
- Track ammunition expenditure
- Report when low (<20% remaining)
- Conserve for high-priority targets

---

### **SAFETY REMINDERS**

**ALWAYS**:
- ✅ Verify target before engaging (PID mandatory)
- ✅ Check for friendly forces
- ✅ Verify NOT in no-fire zone
- ✅ Follow Rules of Engagement (ROE)
- ✅ Have fire authorization (if required)

**NEVER**:
- ❌ Fire without positive identification
- ❌ Fire into no-fire zones
- ❌ Fire if friendlies potentially in line of fire
- ❌ Fire without authorization (if required)
- ❌ Assume tracking is infallible (monitor track quality)
