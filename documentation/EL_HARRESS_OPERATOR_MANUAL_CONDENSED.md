## ⚠️ WARNINGS AND CAUTIONS

### **WARNING**
**LETHAL WEAPON SYSTEM**: This system controls a live weapon platform. Failure to follow safety procedures can result in death or serious injury. Always treat the weapon as if it is loaded and armed.

### **WARNING**
**NO-FIRE ZONES**: Always verify reticle position is NOT in a no-fire zone before engaging. Violating no-fire zones may result in friendly casualties or civilian harm.

### **WARNING**
**EMERGENCY STOP**: The emergency stop button must be accessible at all times. Know its location and be prepared to activate immediately if unsafe conditions develop.

### **CAUTION**
**ELECTRICAL HAZARDS**: The RCWS operates on high-voltage power systems. Only qualified personnel shall perform maintenance. Disconnect power before servicing.

### **WARNING**
**MOVING PARTS**: The gimbal system contains high-speed rotating components. Keep clear of moving parts during operation. Do not place hands or objects near turret during movement.

### **CAUTION**
**CAMERA DAMAGE**: Do not point cameras directly at the sun or intense light sources. Permanent sensor damage may occur.

### **WARNING**
**DEAD MAN SWITCH**: The Dead Man Switch must be held during all weapon operations. Release immediately in emergency situations to safe the weapon.

**3B. GIMBAL MECHANISM**

**Visual Inspection:**
1. Check for fluid leaks (hydraulic/oil)
2. Verify no loose bolts or fasteners
3. Confirm cables are properly routed (not pinched)
4. Look for signs of impact damage
5. Check that gimbal rotates freely by hand (power OFF only)

**Gimbal Axes:**
- **Azimuth Axis** (horizontal rotation): 360° continuous
- **Elevation Axis** (vertical tilt): -20° to +60°

**Mechanical Limits:**
- Hard stops prevent over-rotation
- Limit sensors detect end of travel
- Software limits prevent sensor contact

**GO/NO-GO Criteria:**
- ✅ No fluid leaks
- ✅ Gimbal moves smoothly by hand (power off)
- ✅ No grinding or binding noises
- ✅ All cables secured with proper strain relief
- ❌ Fluid leaks → NO-GO (maintenance required)
- ❌ Binding or resistance → NO-GO (maintenance required)
- ❌ Loose mounting bolts → NO-GO (torque to spec)

**3C. WEAPON MOUNT**

**⚠️ WARNING**: Treat all weapons as loaded. Follow weapon-specific clearing procedures (Appendix A).

**Visual Inspection:**
1. Weapon is properly secured in mount
2. Feed system (belt/magazine) is intact
3. No obstructions in barrel or ejection port
4. Mounting bolts are tight
5. Weapon safety is engaged (if applicable)

**GO/NO-GO Criteria:**
- ✅ Weapon securely mounted
- ✅ Feed mechanism functions properly
- ✅ Barrel clear of obstructions
- ❌ Loose weapon → NO-GO (re-secure per manual)
- ❌ Damaged feed system → NO-GO (repair/replace)
- ❌ Barrel obstruction → NO-GO (clear and inspect)

**3D. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION**

**Check:**
1. Weatherproof covers are intact
2. Drainage holes are not blocked
3. Cable glands are sealed
4. No corrosion on exposed metal
5. Protective covers removed before operation

**GO/NO-GO Criteria:**
- ✅ All seals intact
- ✅ No water ingress visible
- ✅ Drainage holes clear
- ❌ Water pooling inside → NO-GO (dry and check seals)
- ❌ Severe corrosion → NO-GO (maintenance required)

### **WALK-AROUND COMPLETION**

After completing all inspection stations:

1. **Document Results**: Mark checklist (Appendix C) with GO/NO-GO for each item
2. **Report Discrepancies**: Any NO-GO items must be reported to maintenance immediately
3. **Supervisor Review**: Have supervisor verify inspection before operation
4. **Clear Area**: Ensure all personnel clear of turret before power-up
5. **Proceed to Startup**: If all items are GO, proceed with Lesson 2 startup procedure

**SAFETY NOTE**: Never operate RCWS with any NO-GO items. Equipment failure can result in injury or death.

**Key Points:**
- Operator sees video on DCU and controls gimbal with joystick
- Control computer processes all inputs and manages subsystems
- Cameras provide real-time video feedback
- System is a closed-loop: operator adjusts based on what they see

**You don't need to understand the electronics, just the concept:**
- **INPUT**: Your joystick commands
- **PROCESSING**: Computer calculates aim point with ballistics
- **OUTPUT**: Gimbal moves, weapon fires
- **FEEDBACK**: You see results on screen and adjust

## 1.5 SAFETY ZONE CONCEPTS

### NO-FIRE ZONES

**Definition**: Geographic areas where weapon discharge is absolutely prohibited.

**Purpose**:
- Protect friendly forces
- Protect civilians and infrastructure
- Prevent fratricide
- Comply with rules of engagement (ROE)

**How It Works**:
- Zones are pre-programmed by command
- System monitors gimbal position continuously
- **OSD displays "NO-FIRE ZONE" warning** when reticle enters zone
- Trigger is **software locked** when in no-fire zone
- Override requires commander authorization code

**Example No-Fire Zones**:
- Friendly vehicle positions
- Civilian buildings (schools, hospitals, mosques)
- Infrastructure (power plants, water treatment)
- Friendly patrol routes

**Operator Responsibility**:
- **Always check OSD for no-fire zone warning before engaging**
- Do not attempt to fire if warning is displayed
- Report zone boundary errors to command
- Never share override codes

---

### NO-TRAVERSE ZONES

**Definition**: Geographic areas where gimbal movement is restricted or prohibited.

**Purpose**:
- Prevent gimbal from hitting vehicle structure
- Protect antennas, equipment, or personnel on vehicle
- Prevent pointing weapon at vehicle crew positions
- Avoid damaging cables or sensors

**How It Works**:
- Zones are defined during system installation
- Gimbal slew is **automatically stopped** at zone boundary
- You will feel joystick resistance near boundary
- **OSD displays "NO-TRAVERSE" warning** when approaching zone
- System prevents entry even if you force joystick

**Example No-Traverse Zones**:
- Rear 90° arc (to avoid vehicle cabin)
- Areas with antennas or equipment
- Personnel access hatches
- Cable routing areas

**Operator Responsibility**:
- Learn your vehicle's no-traverse zones
- Do not fight the system if gimbal stops
- Report if zones are too restrictive for mission
- Never disable no-traverse zones without authorization

---

### ZONE VIOLATION PROCEDURES

**If you accidentally enter a zone:**

1. **Release Trigger Immediately** (if weapon armed)
2. **Slew gimbal out of zone** using joystick
3. **Verify OSD warning clears**
4. **Report incident** to supervisor
5. **Do not re-enter zone** unless mission requires and authorized

**If system prevents zone entry but mission requires it:**

1. **Do NOT force the system**
2. **Report to commander** immediately
3. **Request zone boundary adjustment** if appropriate
4. **Obtain override authorization** if permitted by ROE
5. **Document all overrides** in mission log

**REMEMBER**: Zones exist for safety. Violating zones can kill friendlies.
